    "## Homework 3: Functions and Hypothesis-Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework begins by reviewing some things we accomplished in class, and defining some functions. Then it asks you to apply those functions to the Bechdel dataset. We won't fully replicate the data analysis performed in [the Bechdel article,](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/) and spelled out (using R) in [this online analysis.](https://mran.microsoft.com/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/vignettes/bechdel.html) But we're going to build some elements of the process from the ground up, so that we genuinely understand what's going on — especially where hypothesis testing is involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should say up front that the approach we're taking to hypothesis-testing here is only one of several possible approaches; it's based on what statisticians call a *frequentist* theory of statistics. *Bayesian* statistics provide an alternative way of reasoning about these questions; we'll glance at that in a couple of weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, let's test the significance of a correlation. We saw in class that movies that fail to pass the Bechdel test have lower median return-on-investment than those that do pass. This hints that movie studios may be controlled by a kind of sexism that is not only unjust, and not only not profitable, but actually self-destructive and money-*losing.* \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, I mentioned in class that there's a potential *confounding variable* in this argument. Movies with lower budgets generally have higher ROI. So perhaps movies that pass the Bechdel test have higher ROI simply *because* they have lower budgets? We won't completely resolve that question below, but we'll build up to it. To begin with, is the relationship between budget and return-on-investment actually meaningful, or would we be likely to see relations of that kind emerge by chance?\n",
    "\n",
    "To test that, we'll start by reconstructing the functions we need for a correlation test."
